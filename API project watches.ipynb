The sleek design caught my eye, but it\\'s the features that truly make it stand out.  The display is vibrant and responsive, providing a clear view of notifications and fitness stats. The fitness tracking capabilities are comprehensive, accurately monitoring my steps, heart rate, and sleep patterns. The integration with the accompanying app is seamless, allowing me to analyze my health data effortlessly.  The battery life is commendable, lasting through a full day of use without any hiccups. The quick charging feature is a game-changer, ensuring I spend more time using the watch and less time waiting for it to power up.  The Fire Bolt Smart Watch also boasts a variety of customizable watch faces, allowing me to personalize my device to match my style and mood. The touch controls are intuitive, making navigation smooth and efficient.  However, I did encounter a slight learning curve when exploring some advanced features, but the user manual provided clear instructions to overcome this. Customer support was also responsive when I had questions, adding to the positive experience.  In conclusion, the Fire Bolt Smart Watch offers an excellent balance of style and functionality. It\\'s a reliable companion for both daily activities and fitness tracking.

Charged it to a 100% before starting to use. Immediately one notices the size of the watch face. Its massive, specially on the arms of a girl/woman. Thankfully my wife said he likes it that way. She downloaded the da fit app. Noticed that when the phone is connected to the watch via bluetooth, the audio from the phone always plays through the watch. I felt this was a bit annoying. Its been a month since she has been using the product. Step tracking is somewhat accurate. But when compared with the steps registered by the phone there is always a discrepancy. I know better than not to expect too much from a budget smartwatch. Hence happy with the device. And so is my wife.',\n",

It is a must try and use product for everyone of all ages. Battery life is also good.  Overall, I would give this watch a 4, because the touch is not that smooth compared to my previous watch.

       "     'review_comment': \"When i first had it on my hand it felt very little. After 18 days of usage it feels normal on my wrist. It has hourly alarm, which you can turn off if you want. You will know that an hour has passed watching youtube. It looks like a luxury watch but at the same time it is very light, a good combination. I don't like those big heavy watches. This watch is more sophisticated. Two things it lacks - 1. Stopwatch does not go beyond 59.99.99. 2. It lacks a timer.Light is dim but there will always be phone on bedside, so not big problem.Overall liked it. Other specs - 7yrs battery life, water resist 30m (it actually has water resistant way beyond that, around 210 meter it breaks). This will be my watch for many years to come. Besides, I like the digital watches more than analogue ones. Digital watches are more accurate, can show day, date along with time.If you don't mind those 2 cons everything is a pro pro. Go for it. Don't think twice.\",\n",

       "     'review_comment': \"Pros:- 1) Great looking watch. It will give you a totally different look and feel.2) Extremely lightweight and comfortable.3) Quality and accuracy of casio at this price.4) Don't go with YouTube review about light. It is enough for watching time in actual dark condition. I have added photo for light.Cons:- 1) It has single locking buckle, double lock gives more confidence.2) Glass is made of resin so risk of scratching is here. Quality of the chain is also not that much great. But it is not bad also, it is good at this price point.Conclusion:- You can go for this vintage timepiece at this price. It will give you a totally different personality and accuracy + assurance of Casio. It may look very small in some video, and even you will find it small at first look after unboxing, but it doesn't look that small in your wrist. It is perfect for 6-7 inches wrist.\",\n",

       "     'review_comment': \"⚠ Read this before you buy ⚠After spending a few days using this product here is a list of What is good , What is bad & Bonus points for achieving an ultimate experience :What is Good :1. The AMOLED screen (*chef kiss*)2. Design & Build quality - feels like premium when you wear it3. Straps - Super comfy & a good fit (please read till the Bonus points, I have a life saving tip for you)4. The Crown - You can keep rotating it all day, works like a charm & also works as a clickable power button5. Battery - Decent battery backup upto 3 days of intense usage6. Calling - Speaker & Mic are pretty good for a quick callWhat is Bad :1. Sensors - They only take readings/records when you place them in a certain angle (yes they are legit sensors however it is difficult for them to actually take a reading in case of thin wrists)2. Watch faces - The given watch faces in the app are very few among which even fewer do justice to the AMOLED screen3. Once you try filling up the warranty google form as per guidelines, it just throws you the error 'Something went wrong'4. UI/UX - there are plenty things wrong w.r.t. the same : - If you switch off the smartwatch by long pressing the crown, it somehow restarts on its own (you have to go to setting > scroll to the bottom to find 'system' > choose your power related options - While plugged for charging, you can't access the watch for notifications/calls etc. (it is practically useless while charging) - While working out, due to the sensors placement/sensitivity accurate tracking is not possible (again, you can't take calls/notifications while in a workout)Bonus Tips :1. In case you want to buy straps of different kind, search for 44mm iwatch straps, Thank me later2. Charge the device with a power brick with Output between 3.5V to 5V unless you want it to explode on the day of purchase3. For a screen guard, visit any local store/shop where phone cases & accessories are available most likely they will have a plastic screen guard available for this screen size4. To exit/pause a workout make sure you swipe left (the user guide nowhere mentions that although they could've simply given the option to quit/pause using the crown/shortcut buttonIn my personal experience i will rate this smartwatch 3.5/5. Hopefully this score changes with software updates and patches\",\n",

       "     'review_comment': \"Fire-Boltt Asteroid Amoled Watch: A Sleek Marvel with Exceptional FeaturesI've had the pleasure of experiencing the Fire-Boltt Asteroid Amoled Watch for the past 10 days, and it's been a blend of delight and a touch of dismay. Let's delve into the details:Design & Build Quality: The first thing that captivates attention is its sleek design and commendable build quality. The premium finish and comfortable strap make it an everyday accessory that seamlessly blends with any attire, whether it's a casual outing or a formal meeting.Display & Functionality: The Amoled display is a showstopper! Vibrant colors and crisp resolution make glancing at notifications, tracking fitness metrics, or even checking the time a joy. The touch response is swift and accurate, elevating the overall user experience.Fitness Tracking & Health Features: The array of health-centric features truly sets this watch apart. From accurate heart rate monitoring to step counting and sleep tracking, it's a reliable fitness companion. The inclusion of multiple workout modes caters to various exercise regimens, ensuring comprehensive fitness monitoring.Battery Life: Here lies the crux of my slight disappointment. While the advertised standby backup of 25 days excited me, the reality falls significantly short. In practical use, the battery lasts a mere 3-4 days without extensive utilization. This aspect certainly warrants improvement, especially considering the emphasis placed on prolonged standby time.Connectivity & Compatibility: Seamless connectivity with my smartphone and the intuitive app interface make for a hassle-free experience. Notifications are timely and accurately mirrored, and the watch's compatibility across various devices enhances its appeal.Final Verdict: The Fire-Boltt Asteroid Amoled Watch is an epitome of style and functionality. Its impressive display, comprehensive health tracking, and seamless connectivity make it a compelling choice in the smartwatch realm. However, the glaring disparity in the advertised versus actual battery standby time is a considerable setback.In conclusion, if you prioritize style, functionality, and can compromise on the standby battery duration, the Fire-Boltt Asteroid Amoled Watch is a worthy addition to your tech arsenal.\",\n",

It's has a variety of features like heart rate, sp02, step count, sleep tracking etc. It also has drinking water reminder which is an great feature.I didn't have any issues with it so far.Pros:* Affordable, worth the money* Multiple features included such as heart rate, sp02, sleep cycle, water drinking reminder and step count( based on real time gps tracking) unlike pedometer.*Multiple Watch Faces(Four in built Faces, two slots changes everytime custom watchface is selected from app)*Sleek, light weight in general and soft watch band.*Good battery life.One thing I would suggest for Noise product developers is that You could include smartwatch storage capacity to store multiple watch faces considering you could store only two watch faces max in smartwatch whereas you could select multiple awesome watch faces from app which is fine with me, could be considered an improvement of upcoming models. Overall the Noise vortex plus is a great smart watch model for the year 2024.\",\n",

The stainless steel construction and the gold finish give it a luxurious look that stands out. The 1.43\" AMOLED display is vibrant and sharp, making it easy to read notifications, track workouts, and navigate through menus, even under bright sunlight thanks to its impressive 700 NITS brightness.One of the standout features for me has been the rotating crown. It not only adds to the elegance but also makes navigating through the watch\\'s interface a breeze.The watch\\'s health and fitness tracking capabilities are comprehensive. With multiple sports modes, accurate heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and more, it\\'s been an excellent companion for my fitness journey. The data synced seamlessly with the accompanying app, allowing me to track my progress effortlessly.Battery life has been surprisingly good, easily lasting through a full day of use with all the features turned on. Charging is quick and convenient, ensuring minimal downtime.While the price might be a bit higher compared to some other options on the market, the build quality, display, and overall performance justify the investment.My only minor concern is with its durability. While the stainless steel is sturdy, I\\'ve noticed some minor scratches, so extra care might be needed.In summary, the Fire-Boltt Ace Luxury Phoenix AMOLED Stainless Steel Smart Watch is a fantastic blend of style and functionality. It\\'s a reliable companion for both everyday use and fitness tracking, offering a premium experience that\\'s worth considering for anyone in search of a high-quality smartwatch.',\n",

But once I opened the box I was so impressed. The packaging looks smart and the watch itself feels fantastic. It’s got a good weight to it which adds to that quality feeling. The watch is covered in protective tape which is a good touch. The minute marked bezel has a very smooth quality feel to it, sapphire crystal is a great option and the Seiko NH35 movement is bliss. Smooth winding and includes hacking. 200m water resistance which is more than I’ll ever need but nice to know it will be safe in water along with the screw down crown. The lume on the watch is amazing! Overall just a fantastic watch for under £200, I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone.',\n",

The XYZ Smartwatch seamlessly connects to my smartphone, providing notifications without any lag. The touch screen is responsive, and navigating through various apps is a breeze.Although it doesn't have all the high-end features of premium smartwatches, it covers the basics exceptionally well. The heart rate monitor and step counter are quite reliable, making it a valuable fitness companion. The watch faces are customizable, allowing a personal touch to suit my style.One minor downside is the absence of GPS, but considering the price point, it's a reasonable compromise. Overall, if you're on a budget and looking for a reliable smartwatch with essential features, the Firebolt Smartwatch is an excellent choice. I highly recommend it!\",\n",

Charged it to a 100% before starting to use. Immediately one notices the size of the watch face. Its massive, specially on the arms of a girl/woman. Thankfully my wife said he likes it that way. She downloaded the da fit app. Noticed that when the phone is connected to the watch via bluetooth, the audio from the phone always plays through the watch. I felt this was a bit annoying. Its been a month since she has been using the product. Step tracking is somewhat accurate. But when compared with the steps registered by the phone there is always a discrepancy. I know better than not to expect too much from a budget smartwatch. Hence happy with the device. And so is my wife.',\n",

This watch is fantastic, it's features (mainly the calling option) strees reliever, sleep mode, music, oxygen level tracking, it's exercise options, (there are many given) weather, alarm, stopwatch, games , calculator, camera, battery saver,voice search etc. Display settings customisation is also good.  It is a must try and use product for everyone of all ages. Battery life is also good.  Overall, I would give this watch a 4, because the touch is not that smooth compared to my previous watch. Also, the heart rate monitoring has some fault. Other than this, this is the best watch out in the market for it's price.\",\n",

       "     'review_comment': 'I\\'ve been using the Fire-Boltt Ace Luxury Phoenix AMOLED Stainless Steel Smart Watch for a few weeks now, and it\\'s truly exceeded my expectations.The first thing that caught my eye was its stunning design. The stainless steel construction and the gold finish give it a luxurious look that stands out. The 1.43\" AMOLED display is vibrant and sharp, making it easy to read notifications, track workouts, and navigate through menus, even under bright sunlight thanks to its impressive 700 NITS brightness.One of the standout features for me has been the rotating crown. It not only adds to the elegance but also makes navigating through the watch\\'s interface a breeze.The watch\\'s health and fitness tracking capabilities are comprehensive. With multiple sports modes, accurate heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and more, it\\'s been an excellent companion for my fitness journey. The data synced seamlessly with the accompanying app, allowing me to track my progress effortlessly.Battery life has been surprisingly good, easily lasting through a full day of use with all the features turned on. Charging is quick and convenient, ensuring minimal downtime.While the price might be a bit higher compared to some other options on the market, the build quality, display, and overall performance justify the investment.My only minor concern is with its durability. While the stainless steel is sturdy, I\\'ve noticed some minor scratches, so extra care might be needed.In summary, the Fire-Boltt Ace Luxury Phoenix AMOLED Stainless Steel Smart Watch is a fantastic blend of style and functionality. It\\'s a reliable companion for both everyday use and fitness tracking, offering a premium experience that\\'s worth considering for anyone in search of a high-quality smartwatch.',\n",

And the dial is quite touch sensitive, the phone pair has caused a lot of accidentally butt dialling so i disabled that feature. being bulky not comfortable to wear to sleep, so have not used the sleep tracking feature. The strap magnet is quite strong so the charger and magnet get stuck quite often so balancing them to charge needs to be careful\",\n",

But once I opened the box I was so impressed. The packaging looks smart and the watch itself feels fantastic. It’s got a good weight to it which adds to that quality feeling. The watch is covered in protective tape which is a good touch. The minute marked bezel has a very smooth quality feel to it, sapphire crystal is a great option and the Seiko NH35 movement is bliss. Smooth winding and includes hacking. 200m water resistance which is more than I’ll ever need but nice to know it will be safe in water along with the screw down crown. The lume on the watch is amazing! Overall just a fantastic watch for under £200, I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone.',\n",

       "     'review_comment': 'Best watch under segment. Performance is soo good. The first impression is tooo good. I recommend this to everyone.I’ve been using the Fire-Boltt Quest Smart Watch for a few weeks now, and it has exceeded my expectations in many ways! It’s not just a watch; it’s like a fitness coach, a health monitor, and a personal assistant all rolled into one sleek device.Design and Comfort:The design of this watch is a perfect blend of style and functionality. It sports a slim profile and a comfortable strap, making it easy to wear all day and night. The touch screen is responsive and displays vibrant colors, enhancing the overall user experience.Fitness and Health Tracking:The fitness tracking capabilities are top-notch. It tracks a wide range of activities including walking, running, cycling, and more. The heart rate monitor is impressively accurate, and I found the sleep tracking feature particularly insightful. It’s great for keeping an eye on your overall wellness.Battery Life and Performance:Battery life is outstanding. I easily get about a week of use with regular tracking and notifications, which is quite impressive. Charging is quick too, adding to the convenience.Smart Features:The integration with my smartphone is seamless. Notifications, weather updates, and even music controls are just a wrist-tap away. I love how it keeps me connected without having to constantly reach for my phone.Conclusion:Overall, the Fire-Boltt Quest is a fantastic smartwatch. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast, a busy professional, or just someone who loves tech, this watch is a great choice. It offers a perfect mix of style, functionality, and durability. Highly recommended!',\n",

Touchscreen is smoothThe watch faces are nice  and premiumSPO2 and heartrate and sleep sensors seem to be working fineBattery life is also decent .Drains 5-10 percent while walking /other activities and 10 percent while you are asleep and dont use it . So I am assuming 20-25% percent in a day if you are average userCons :There is no AOD (Always on Display) which even 1000Rs watches are giving nowadaysRaise to wake feature  doesnt work properly so u have to use button to see the timeAlthough Brand claims GPS feature , the watch doesnt catch GPS SignalSpeaker sound is low so u wont be able to enjoy music on watch speakerFinal Review : This is probably the best looking watch in this price segment so if you want to buy a watch only for the looks then this will be a good choice . However its not a perfect smartwatch since many features dont work as expected or dont work at all!!',\n",

       "     'review_comment': 'Got a smartwatch after a long time, given the attractive pricing on sale.  Chose BOAT as Country of origin was India.  Surprisingly, order two watches with different straps, while one arrived in one day the other in 5 days, not sure why.  Coming to the watch itself.  It is good, my wrist is small, so this is one of the few watches with a smaller size.  The screen is good, the watch faces are good, but the advertised watch face is not available which was disappointing and cost a star in this review.  Please read the manual fully, to make the most of all available features as it is not intuitive.  For the first few days, I could not locate the controls to take SPO readings and capture activity, it was by chance that I found these controls.  Highlighting this as the SPO2 reflected does not give an option to take reading, you have to get to the reading screen through a different route.  So far happy with the watch for the price at which this was offered.  Auto recognition of activity would be great.',\n",

It's remarkably bright, making it easy to use even in direct sunlight. The sharpness of the AMOLED panel further enhances the visual experience. Additionally, I appreciate the multitude of features available on the watch, eliminating the need to constantly dive into the app for settings adjustments.The user interface is impressively smooth, with no noticeable lag. However, I do wish it had an assistant feature, which could add another layer of functionality.I must also mention that the fit of the watch is excellent, with both comfort and a snug feel. It's so comfortable that I can even wear it while sleeping without any issues. Moreover, the watch's weight is pleasantly light, adding to the overall comfort and ease of use.In terms of battery life, it's not bad at all. With features like always-on display and continuous heart rate monitoring enabled, I manage to get 3 to 4 days of battery life. That said, there's room for improvement, and longer battery life would be appreciated.Another feature I'd love to see is quick reply support for WhatsApp and other messaging apps, as this would make communication even more convenient.The one area that could use some improvement is the quality of the strap, as it doesn't seem particularly durable.Overall, considering its price point of ₹2500 rupees, this smartwatch offers good quality and a wide range of features, making it a worthwhile purchase.\",\n",
